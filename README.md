# Java Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains code for a Java Object-Oriented Programming lab. The purpose of this lab is to introduce students to the concepts of object-oriented programming and provide hands-on practice with Java.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Netbeans IDE 14 or IntelliJ IDEA

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Wipupat-Chomthaworn/Object-Oriented-Programming.git`.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Run the `Main` class to execute the program.

## Usage

The program demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It includes several classes that represent different types of shapes, and a `Main` class that creates instances of these shapes and performs various operations on them.
